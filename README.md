# RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program ‚Äì IIT Gandhinagar & VSD

Welcome to my **RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program** repository!  
This repo contains my **weekly tasks, notes, and learnings** from the program conducted by [VLSI System Design (VSD)](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/).

The program is all about taking a design **from RTL to silicon**, exploring each stage of the **ASIC design flow** using both **open-source and commercial EDA tools**. It‚Äôs an opportunity to work hands-on with the **RISC-V ISA**, understand SoC design, and experience what it takes to get a chip ready for **tapeout**.

## üìå Program Overview
The **RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program** is a **20-week hands-on training** jointly organized by **IIT Gandhinagar** and **VSD**.  

- **Objective**: Train participants in the **end-to-end chip design flow**  
- **Flow Covered**: RTL ‚Üí Synthesis ‚Üí STA ‚Üí Floorplanning ‚Üí Placement & Routing ‚Üí GDSII (Tapeout)  
- **EDA Tools**: Synopsys, Yosys, OpenLane, OpenTimer, Magic  
- **PDKs**: SCL180nm and SkyWater130  

This initiative, titled **‚ÄúFrom Silicon to Sovereignty‚Äù**, empowers students, educators, and professionals to gain **practical VLSI design expertise** and contribute to the growing **RISC-V ecosystem**.
